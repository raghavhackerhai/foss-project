 Password Hygiene Analyzer
**Project Title: Password Hygiene Analyser**  

**Description:**  
The Password Hygiene Analyser is designed to enhance user security by analyzing password usage patterns and providing insights into password strength and uniqueness. It consists of three core models:  

1. **Password Strength Analyzer:** This model evaluates the strength of passwords used for logging into accounts. It checks for key security metrics such as length, complexity (use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters), and resistance to common attack methods (e.g., brute force or dictionary attacks). Based on these metrics, it provides a strength score and suggestions for improvement.  

2. **Password Similarity Checker:** This model analyzes the types of passwords used across all accounts accessed from a particular device. It identifies patterns and similarities in passwords to assess the risk of password reuse. By highlighting instances of repeated or slightly modified passwords, it encourages better password management practices and minimizes the risk of multiple account compromises.  

3. **Password Commonality Evaluator:** This model allows users to upload a dataset containing a list of passwords. It compares these passwords against a large database of known common passwords to evaluate how frequently each password is used by other people. This helps users understand the popularity and vulnerability of their chosen passwords, promoting the use of more unique and secure alternatives.  

This project not only enhances user awareness of password security but also encourages better password hygiene practices to safeguard sensitive information.
